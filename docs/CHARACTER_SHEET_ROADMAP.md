# Character Sheet — roadmap

What is worth building next, and why. Ordered by value, not by effort. Tick items off as they
land; add new ones at the bottom of their tier.

Done so far: the builder and sheet themselves, the choice engine, the leveling engine, structured
proficiencies, "choose one" species traits, per-character source filtering, stat provenance,
the UI rework, the sidekick builder, print/PDF export, and the test/CI setup below.

---

## Now

- [x] **CI that runs the tests.** `npm test` existed but nothing invoked it; a push ran nothing.
      Now `.github/workflows/charactersheet-ci.yml` lints, unit-tests, checks the generated pages
      match their templates, and runs the browser tests on every push and pull request.
- [x] **Browser tests in the repo.** 136 checks across eight suites in `test/e2e/`, promoted from
      throwaway scripts. They caught real regressions repeatedly while the sheet was being built.
- [x] **Sidekick builder** (`sidekick.html`, in the DM menu). Both published rulesets, read from
      data: the Essentials Kit's three types with their roles (healer/mage, attacker/defender) and
      its fixed level table driving a one-click level-up, and any bestiary stat block plus a TCE
      sidekick class for levels past 6. Traits & Actions is a list of editable rows. Everything
      stays hand-editable, and a sidekick is just a character with `isSidekick: true`, so it reuses
      the whole engine.
- [x] **Print / PDF output.** The *Print* button on every page. Character pages print as a plain
      sheet, sidekicks as a stat-block card. `_bindPrintPrep` works around what browsers refuse
      to print: textarea overflow, closed `<details>`, and panels with nothing in them.

---

## Next — rules gaps a player hits at the table

- [x] **Resistances, immunities and senses are structured.** A *Defenses & Senses* panel on all
      three pages, grouped by kind and attributed to whatever granted each one — species, feat,
      trait pick, equipped item, or added by hand. Read from the data in every case. Gear grants
      only while it is worn (and the chip says so); a trait pick's resistance follows the pick.
      Nothing is copied into the notes box any more.
- [x] **Exhaustion now costs what it should.** −2 per level on every d20 test: ability checks,
      saving throws, skills, initiative, passive Perception and attack rolls, weapon and spell
      alike. Not on a spell save DC, which is set rather than rolled, and not on damage. Each
      affected number's breakdown names exhaustion as the reason, and the counter says what it is
      costing ("−4 to d20 tests, −10 ft. speed").
- [x] **The concentration save is prompted.** Losing hit points while concentrating raises a
      prompt with the DC (10, or half the damage), the spell's name, a Constitution save to roll,
      and *Kept it* / *Lost it* — the latter clearing the spell. Watches the hit-point value rather
      than the Damage button, so typing a lower number counts; healing and switching characters do
      not.
- [x] **Item charges and ammunition.** An item with charges shows what it has left and spends them
      a click at a time; a rest gives back exactly what the item says (`1d6 + 1` at dawn is rolled,
      not assumed), and only on the rest that recharges it. Ammunition has *Fire*, and the
      battlefield search that recovers half of what was spent.
- [x] **Stale "assign manually" notes.** A skipped ability increase is now an outstanding offer
      shown beside the ability scores, with *Assign now* (which walks the original choice) and
      *Dismiss*. Assigning settles it, and an old character's note is migrated into one on load.

## Later — quality of life

- [ ] **Print polish.** The print path now works and is tested by hand, but it has no automated
      coverage, and a long character still spills onto a third page. Worth a pass once the layout
      settles: tighter margins, a deliberate page break between play data and reference text.
- [ ] **Accessibility.** Focus rings, labels on icon-only buttons, keyboard access to the feature
      cards. Noticed during the UI rework and deliberately left out of its scope.
- [ ] **Character portrait and appearance fields.**
- [ ] **Sharing a character** with a DM — a link or an export they can open read-only.
- [ ] **Homebrew.** 5etools has a homebrew loader; the builder ignores it entirely, so a
      homebrew class or species cannot be picked.

## Housekeeping

- [x] **Protect `main`.** Branch rulesets are in place for `main` and `beta`, so the
      "Sync fork → Discard commits" button can no longer wipe the fork.
      (It already did once; see `CHARACTER_SHEET_MAINTENANCE.md`.)
- [ ] **Prove the nightly upstream sync.** `.github/workflows/sync-upstream.yml` has never fired.
      Run it once by hand from the Actions tab.
- [ ] **Port the remaining ad-hoc smokes** — magic-item bonuses, multiclass Expertise, origin
      feats, the session/store round-trip — into `test/e2e/` as their coverage is needed.
